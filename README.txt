The Procrastination Visualizer is a simple To-Do List app that links each item's font size with its age. The older an item is, the larger it appears on the screen.
 
If an entire week passes and the item has still not been completed, that item's font switches to Comic Sans and continues to grow larger.

List items are saved using localStorage.
